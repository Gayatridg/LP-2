Theory_dfs&bfs


Sure! Let me explain DFS and BFS in simpler terms:

DFS (Depth-First Search)
DFS means you start at one point in the graph and go as deep as possible down one path before backtracking. It's like exploring one branch of a tree all the way to the end before you check out other branches.

Recursive DFS is a way to do this where the computer calls itself to go deeper into the graph. It uses a stack to remember which nodes to visit next.

How DFS works:
Start at the first node.

Visit that node.

Go to a neighboring node and repeat until you can't go any further.

Once you hit a dead-end (no more neighbors), go back to the previous node and try another path.

Example:
If the graph looks like this:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
A -- B -- C
|    |
D -- E
Starting at A, the DFS order could be:
A -> B -> C -> E -> D

BFS (Breadth-First Search)
BFS means you explore all the neighbors of a node first before going deeper. It's like if you're in a building and you visit all the rooms on the first floor before going to the next floor.

Recursive BFS is not the usual way, but you can simulate it. Normally, BFS uses a queue to keep track of which node to visit next.

How BFS works:
Start at the first node.

Visit that node, then visit all of its neighbors (the nodes directly connected to it).

After visiting the first level of neighbors, move on to the next level (nodes connected to the neighbors).

Repeat until there are no more nodes to visit.

Example:
If the graph looks like this:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
A -- B -- C
|    |
D -- E
Starting at A, the BFS order could be:
A -> B -> D -> C -> E

Key Differences Between DFS and BFS:
DFS:

Explores deep into the graph first.

It’s like going down a path until you can’t go further, and then backtracking to try another path.

Example: Going down one long hallway in a house, checking every room until you hit a dead-end.

BFS:

Explores wide first. It checks all nodes that are directly connected before going deeper.

It’s like checking all rooms on the same floor before going to the next floor.

Example: Visiting every room on the current floor before moving up to the next floor.
